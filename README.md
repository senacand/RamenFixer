# RamenFixer - VMC❤️NoodleExtensions
This mod fixes issue where VMC Avatar does not respect the Player's position and rotation that are set by NoodleExtensions (PlayerTrack). **THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## Demo
**Without RamenFixer**, VMC Avatar doesn't play nicely with NoodleExtensions.

**With RamenFixer**, VMC Avatar moves as dictated by the NoodleExtensions map.

Yes, in case you're wondering, **it works on the 'slow-mo' part of Analys too**!

## Known Issues
1. Position/Rotation Update is not immediate, therefore some maps such as Washing Machine would be extremely janky.
2. This is my very first Beat Saber mod I've ever developed. Do expect bugs and report them by **creating an Issue**!
